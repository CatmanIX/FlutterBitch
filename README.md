#Introduction

FlutterBitch is an IRC bot on Canternet that helps out with [BerryTube](http://berrytube.tv)
related functions. Functionally, she is 99.9% similar to willie, a fork of jenni, which is 
itself a fork of phenny, which is the bot that originally stayed in #MyLittleAlcoholic, 
which is the original (as far as I know) alcoholic brony IRC. At the very least, it's the 
official /r/mylittlealcoholic IRC room, so there's that.

#Installation/Configuration/etc

Installation is identical to the willie installation process So is editing modules and stuff. So is the configuration.

#Why fork it, then?

Basically because I needed to edit some strings to make the bot bitchier, but also because there are at least two pony-specific modules that are very important to us, but probably not to anyone else.

#Questions?

If it's an issue that's been in willie but not yet in FlutterBitch, just pop in to #BerryTube on irc.canternet.org and let miggyb know, but if it's affecting willie as well, their support thing is #tech on irc.dftba.net and they're probably a bit more knowledgeable about it anyway
